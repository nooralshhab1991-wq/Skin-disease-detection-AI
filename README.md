# Skin Disease Detection using Deep Learning

This project is an AI-based system for detecting skin diseases using Deep Learning models.
It aims to assist in early diagnosis by classifying skin lesion images into different disease categories.

## Project Overview
Skin diseases are common and may require early detection.
This project applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with transfer learning to build an accurate classification model.

---

## Models Used
Two EfficientNet architectures were implemented and compared:

- EfficientNetB0  
- EfficientNetB3  

After evaluation, EfficientNetB0 achieved better performance with our dataset and was selected as the final model.
